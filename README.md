For this project I performed an exploratory data analysis of Covid Deaths and Vaccinations through MS SQL Server, to find out:

•	The number of continents,

•	The possibility of dying if contracting COVID in USA,

•	The percentage of population infected with COVID in USA,

•	The countries with highest COVID infection per population,

•	The countries with highest death per population from COVID,

•	The continents with highest death per population from COVID,

•	The number of people in the world that has received COVID vaccines per day.

I have also created a dashboard of results found using Tableau: https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/alejandro.castaneda2167/viz/CovidDatasetExamplefromSQLServer1tutorial/Dashboard1
